### Database Schema Updates

- Added 'groupSize' to Booking model for group bookings

## 💡 Design Decisions & Architecture

### State Management Structure
```javascript
store/
  - authSlice (user, token, isAuthenticated)
  - trailSlice (trails, filters, selectedTrail)
  - bookingSlice (bookings, currentBooking, bookingStep)
  - uiSlice (loading, errors, notifications)
```

### Component Architecture Pattern
- Using container/presentational components
- Custom hooks for API calls (useTrails, useBookings)
- Context for theme/preferences

## 🐛 Known Issues/Bugs

1. **Issue**: Mobile menu not closing after navigation
   **Temporary Fix**: Added onClick handler to menu items
   **Proper Fix Needed**: Update navigation state in Redux

2. **Issue**: Date picker showing past dates
   **Status**: Need to add minDate prop

## 📝 Next Steps (Priority Order)

2. Add pagination to booking list
3. Implement booking cancellation UI
4. Test payment webhook handling
